# Why hello there, come inside for a cup of coffee will you? ☕



## Welcome to my github, this is where I will be hosting most of my projects. I will mainly be working on some projects, notably Catlun. If you desire to learn some more, you may read a bit about me down below.



### Who are you?
Hi, I'm Catsol or Claire. I'm a student currently working on expanding my portfolio and experience to prepare for college and the workforce.

### Anything notable about you?
Honestly, not in particular. I am an avid gamer and a trans gal into computer science (shocking eh?)
I greatly enjoy playing Garry's Mod, Minecraft, League of Legends, and Genshin Impact. I love both software and hardware, especially Linux and building computers and accessories.

### Anything you are particularly good at?
I am pretty excellent at Redneck Engineering™ and whatever my current hobby is typically.

### Any other miscellaneous info?
I am an avid supporter of the LGBTQ community, being the B and T. If you ever need help with anything my DMs are open and I check frequently for the most part!
