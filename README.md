# Why hello there, come inside for a cup of coffee will you? ☕



## Welcome to my github, this is where I will be hosting most of my projects. I will mainly be working on some projects, notably Catlun and likely several websites and possibly Discord bots.

### 🌸 | Who are you?
Hi, I'm Catsol or Claire. I'm a student currently working on expanding my portfolio and experience to prepare for college and the workforce.

### 🍀 | Anything notable about you?
Honestly, not in particular. I am an avid gamer and a trans gal into computer science (shocking eh?)
I greatly enjoy playing Garry's Mod, Minecraft, League of Legends, and Genshin Impact.

### 🌸 | Anything you are particularly good at?
I am pretty excellent at redneck engineering and whatever hobby I am fixated on at the time.

### 🍀 | Any other miscellaneous info?
I am an avid supporter of the LGBTQ community, being bisexual and trans myself.
